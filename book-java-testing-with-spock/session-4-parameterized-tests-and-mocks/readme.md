# Instructions

## Parameterized test - EnterpriseKitchen_OpenAndCleanTest

There are a couple of prepared tests in the EnterpriseKitchen_OpenAndCleanTest.groovy file.  
Refactor, improve and clean up these tests and improve the code as much possible.
All of the hours of the day should be taken into consideration if possible.

## Mocked / Stubbed tests - EnterpriseKitchen_FoodTest

Thoroughly test EnterpriseKitchen.prepareFoodFor(...) function.  
Additional requirements are that the only object in the test suite can be the object under test,
all other variables should contain only Mocks or Stubs.  
For additional bonus, avoid using Mocks as Stubs.
