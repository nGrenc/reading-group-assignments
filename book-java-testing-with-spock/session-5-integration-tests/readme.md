# Instructions

## Just take a look

There will be no work assignment this time,  
as the required examples are difficult to come up with.

But nonetheless, I encourage you to read through the examples described here  
https://github.com/kkapelon/java-testing-with-spock/tree/master/chapter7

Reading through these examples will help you get a better grasp of how 
integration and functional tests look like.

## Extra

So you want additional work, huh?!  
In that case, create an application from scratch, which serves REST requests 
and is able to
1) Change data sent in POST request body from lowercase to uppercase
1) Change data sent as GET request argument from lowercase to uppercase
1) Tell its status - just respond "I am online" on GET /status 
I advise you to use Spring Boot for this and we will take a look at these applications in the next reading group session
