# Instructions

## FailingTest

Improve the test error report as much as possible.  
Do not fix the test itself. You can annotate it @Ignore after you are done.

## FileManipulationTest

Improve tests with cleanup: blocks and cleanup() functions.  
All tests should pass at the end.  
Do not forget to improve the readability of the tests as much as possible.

## SideEnterpriseCannonTest

Create a test suite and achieve 100% coverage of written classes.   
Test suite should be improved as much as possible in the form of readability:
  - all test names should be descriptive
  - all blocks have comments
  - and: block is used
  - subject class is properly annotated (@Subject)
  - @Title & @Narrative are used  
  
Feel free to improve the source file as well, without changing any functionality!  
Realize the term "It's a trap" is not actually used in Star Trek.

You are done.
