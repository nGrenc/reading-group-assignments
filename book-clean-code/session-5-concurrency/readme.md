# Instructions

Very simple:  
You are not allowed to change or delete any file in the package *at.jit.readinggroup.fixedfiles*,  
nor are you allowed to add any new files here. You are also not allowed to change the test-suite  
named *ConcurrencyTaskTest*, but are encouraged to add new tests for untested code.

When all of the tests in *ConcurrencyTaskTest* test-suite successfully run, your task is completed.
